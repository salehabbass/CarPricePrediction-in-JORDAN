### About Dataset : <br>
The dataset contains of 14100 records with 10 columns: car_make, model,	year,	transmition,	kilometers,	car_customs,	fuel,	engine_size, payment method and	price, the dataset is scraped from the internet, it contains a lot of null values and incorrect prices of cars which needs a lot of efforts for preprocessing.<br>
### About the Project : <br>
Car Price prediction in jordan is a project to predict the car price in jordan depends on several factors like main brand, model, year, transmision, engine size and fuel.<br>
The data were used from jordan souq of cars, I have cleaned the data, encoded and normalized the features and  I have applied several machine learning models like svm, linear regression, decision tree
and the best one was the random forest which gave 3400 RMSE.<br> the project is able to expand in the future by adding more features or by making a predictions depends on photos of the cars.
you can upload the data in csv format in data directory.
you can review my analysis and cleaning steps in .ipynb file.
to  interact with a model, I have created a simple gui which ask you to insert your features and predict your car price you can run the gui by following the steps:<br>
1- download the GUI directory in your local machine.<br>
2- unzip it.<br>
3- unzip random forest regressor inside gui directory.<br>
4- open the terminal in your local machine and move to gui directory using cd commands. example: if gui directory in the desktop type (cd Desktop) then click enter then type (cd GUI) then click enter.<br>
5- notice that you are in the GUI directory then write the following command (python gui.py) then click enter, wait for a seconds then you will see the gui<br>
